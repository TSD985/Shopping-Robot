### Shopping Robot â€“ RPA-Based Shopping Assistant
This project is a browser automation bot built using Robotic Process Automation (RPA) tools. It simulates the online shopping process by allowing users to:

- Choose a shopping website (e.g., Amazon, Flipkart)
- Search for a product
- Filter by brand
- View the results automatically

The bot handles browser interaction and provides a user-friendly, guided experience.

### How It Works

1. **Website Selection :**  
   - The bot prompts the user to select an e-commerce site (e.g., Amazon, Flipkart).
   - It navigates to the selected website.
2. **Product Search Input :**  
   - The bot asks the user to enter the product they want to search for (e.g., shoes, laptops).
3. **Brand Specification :**  
   - After the product input, it requests a specific brand name (e.g., Nike, Apple) to refine the results.
4. **Automated Search Execution :**  
   - The bot combines the product and brand inputs.
   - It enters the search query into the website and initiates the search.
5. **Smooth Page Browsing :**
   - Once the results are loaded, the bot scrolls through the page automatically.
   - This simulates a natural browsing experience.
